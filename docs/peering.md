Peering
=======

BonoboNET is very open to peering with new servers.

## Peering process

Below is a guide for peering your server onto BonoboNET.

### Peering rules

Make sure you abide by the normal rules as put out in [Rules](rules.md) and then the additional peering rules:

1. You will **NOT** run any services on the network.
	* `services.bnet` is the dedicated services host operated by `rany`
2. You will not link any servers to the network without running it through `rany` or `deavmi` first
3. You will update your configuration when requested
4. You will be on the `#opers` and `#bnet` channels always
5. You will use the following [motd](motd.md)

### Finding a peer

First you need to find someone who is already running a BonoboNET node and available for peering.

You will then notify either `rany` or `deavmi` and provide details on who you are and who you want to link with. The person
you want to link with must follow this whole document as well as the others within this [section](join.md).
