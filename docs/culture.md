## BurnMJD

A _maverick_ of the BNET scene. We recommend you do not ask this man _"Why is X wrong in the world?"_.
Our justification for this is the answer will always be the same.

Good ways to start a conversation with `burnmjd`, try using words like these:

1. sussy
2. baka
3. sheesh
4. no cap
5. fr
6. bruh

## Read error

Whenever you see a user leave a chat like this:

```
[03:21:19] <-- chrisbot (chrisbot@86BAD863:E96C5F38:7B2E887B:IP) has quit (Read error)
```

You should then think:

> Read error is when socket
