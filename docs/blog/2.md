Services migration
==================

_Published at: 13th December 2021_

We have officially migrated the `services.bnet` Atheme services daemon from the (now defunct) `sparrow.bnet` node to a new node, `braveheart.bnet`. `sparrow.bnet` was always a very stable node but we have since moved it to another (just as if not slightly more) stable node run by Neil Alexander's [NeilNix service]() (see top service on that page for more information) and managed by I, `deavmi`, and `rany`.

All services are running fine and we look ahead to the future to see what more we can do to improve BonoboNET!
