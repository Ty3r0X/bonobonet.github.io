## Contacting the admins

Before you are able to link in you will need to acquire some information from the
network administrators, you can contact one of the two network administrators
with a request to join BonoboNET and the server's name that you have chosen
(this must end with `.bnet`, so `<myName>.bnet`)

1. `deavmi` (deavmi@redxen.eu)
2. `rany` (ranycrxn@riseup.net)

After contacting a network administrator you will be given two pieces of information,
one of which will be your `sid` (server identifier) and another will be a so-called
_"remote include"_ which will be used later in your configuration file. You will also
be provided with a subdomain in `*.irc.bnet.eu.org` which will be for use with your
node.
